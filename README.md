# Welcome to User_dashboard

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Project Description

* This is basically a user dashboard application where a logged in user can see all the user available in the database.Also he can update the user and delete a user permanently from the database.

* Here I have used ReactJS for developing my frontend and for the backend code I have used Nodejs and express.js as a frameworks.

* I have used netlify as a live hosting platform.
